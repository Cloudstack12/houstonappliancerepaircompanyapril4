                <h2>Fixing a Loose Door Seal</h2>
                <p>
                    To fix a loose door seal, follow these steps: <br>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Clean the door seal thoroughly using mild detergent and warm water. Dry the seal with a clean cloth.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Use a hairdryer on a low setting to soften the seal. Gently mold it back into place with your fingers.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Check the seal for any remaining gaps or tears. Use a silicone sealant to fill any gaps or replace the seal if damaged.
                        </li><br>

                    </ol>
                    Ensuring the door seal is completely dry before closing the refrigerator door is essential. A wet seal can cause it to stick to the door frame, potentially causing it to tear or become loose again.

                <h2>Causes of a Freezer Not Defrosting</h2>
                <p>
                    The most common causes of a freezer not defrosting are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Faulty defrost timer: The defrost timer controls the freezer's defrost cycle. The freezer may not enter the defrost cycle if it is defective. 
                        </li> <br>
                        <li>
                            Defrost thermostat: The defrost thermostat regulates the temperature in the freezer. The freezer may not enter the defrost cycle if it is faulty.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Defrost heater: The defrost heater is responsible for melting the ice and frost that builds up in the freezer during the defrost cycle. If it is faulty, the ice and frost will continue to build up in the freezer.

                        </li>
                    </ol>

                <h2>How to Diagnose the Issue</h2>
                <p>
                    To diagnose the issue of a freezer not defrosting, follow these steps: <br>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Unplug the freezer and remove all the food items.</li><b></b>
                        <li>Remove the back panel of the freezer to access the evaporator coils.</li><br>
                        <li>Check the evaporator coils for any signs of frost or ice build-up. If there is a significant amount of ice build-up, the freezer must be adequately defrosted.</li><br>
                        <li>Use a multimeter to test the defrost thermostat and defrost heater for continuity. If either of these components has no continuity, they are faulty and must be replaced.</li><br>
                        <li>Test the defrost timer to ensure that it is functioning correctly. If it is not, it may need to be replaced.</li><br>

                    </ol>
